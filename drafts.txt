I am a Research Assistant in Mohammad Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in the United Arab Emirates advised by Dr. Salman H Khan of MBZUAI and Dr. Sadeep Jayasumana of Google Research. My current research is on vision-language models for long-tail visual recognition.

I did my undergraduate studies at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, where I completed my bachelors thesis on Learning representations for 3D pointclouds and semantic manipulation of 3D pointcloud objects. The thesis was advised by Dr. Ranga Rodrigo and Dr. Kanchana Thilakarathna.

Previously, I interned as a visiting student researcher at the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney, Australia.

My broader research interests are in vision-language models, multimodal learning, and self-supervised learning.

Research

3DLatNav: Navigating generative latent spaces for semantic aware 3D object manipulation
Amaya Dharmasiri, Dinithi Dissanayake, Isuru Dissanayake, Mohamed Afham, Ranga Rodrigo, and Kanchana Thilakarathna
Learning to Generate 3D Objects and Scenes - ECCV 2022 Workshop
paper / code
Developed a point cloud autoencoder architecture to apply controllable transformations to 3D objects via latent space manipulations while preserving perceptual quality of 3D objects and their intended utility in Mixed Reality applications.

CrossPoint: Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning for 3D Point Cloud Understanding
Mohamed Afham, Isuru Dissanayake, Dinithi Dissanayake, Amaya Dharmasiri, Kanchana Thilakarathna, and Ranga Rodrigo.
CVPR 2022
paper / code
Introduced a joint learning objective encapsulating intra-modal correspondence within point cloud modality and cross-modal correspondence between point cloud and 2D image modalities, leveraging contrastive learning.
Produced state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks; 3D object classification, few-shot object classification and 3D object part segmentation.

User configurable 3D object regeneration for spatial privacy
Arpit Nama, Amaya Dharmasiri, Kanchana Thilakarathna, Albert Y. Zomaya, Jaybie Agullo de Guzman
Preprint - Arxiv
Proposed a privacy-preserving encoding for 3D point cloud objects with a continuous privilege spectrum for user-controllability of object privacy in mixed-reality applications.
Evaluated the performance of the encoding against simulated object reidentification attacks using state-of-the-art point cloud classifiers.

Viewport-aware dynamic 360-degree video segment categorization
Amaya Dharmasiri, Chamara Kattadige, Vincent Zhang, and Kanchana Thilakarathna.
NOSSDAV at ACM MMSys 2021
paper / code
Developed a dynamic categorisation framework for 360-degree video segments based on user viewport trends.
This categorization is intended to support efficient caching and resource utilisation in tile-based 360 degree video streaming process.
